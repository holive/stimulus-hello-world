No React this time:

How does it work? Sprinkle your HTML with controller, target, and action attributes:

```html

<div data-controller="hello">
    <input data-hello-target="name" type="text">

    <button data-action="click->hello#greet">Greet</button>

    <span data-hello-target="output"></span>
</div>
```

Then write a compatible controller. Stimulus brings it to life automatically:

```js
// hello_controller.js
import { Controller } from "@hotwired/stimulus"

export default class extends Controller {
    static targets = ["name", "output"]
	
    greet() {
        this.outputTarget.textContent = `Hello, ${this.nameTarget.value}!`
    }
}
```
